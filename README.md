# Webscrapping
**Web Scraping with Python**

Web scraping is the process of programmatically extracting data from websites using tools and scripts. This guides provides an introduction to scraping the web with Python using popular libraries like Beautiful Soup and Selenium.

**Getting Started**

Before you can scrape a website, you need to determine:

**What data you need to extract**

Where that data is located in the HTML of the site
Whether the site has anti-scraping measures in place
It's also important to check the site's terms of service - some sites prohibit scraping.

Use your browser's developer tools to inspect page elements and understand how data is structured.

**Libraries**

Popular Python libraries for web scraping include:

Beautiful Soup - Excellently parses HTML and XML documents. Useful for basic crawling of web pages.

Selenium - Launches and controls a web browser like Firefox or Chrome programmatically. Allows javascript pages to render before scraping.

Requests - Sends HTTP requests to fetch web pages. Typically used to download pages that Beautiful Soup then parses.

pandas - Helpful for storing scraped data in structured DataFrames and easily exporting as CSV.
